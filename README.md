# GoMarble Review Scraper Project

## Introduction

This project is an API server designed to extract reviews from product pages. It leverages OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically identify CSS selectors for reviews and uses Selenium for automated browser interactions to handle pagination and collect all reviews. The API supports platforms such as Shopify and Amazon.

## System Workflow

The workflow for the project is illustrated below:

### Components:

1. **User Input**
   - Users submit the URL of a product page to retrieve reviews.

2. **API Server**
   - Manages incoming requests and communicates with the scraper module.

3. **Scraper Module**
   - Utilizes Selenium for automated scraping and OpenAI for CSS selector identification.

4. **OpenAI API**
   - Dynamically identifies relevant CSS selectors from the HTML content.

5. **Data Processing**
   - Compiles the extracted reviews into JSON format.

6. **Hosting**
   - The API is deployed on Railway for public access.

- **Pagination Support**: Automatically navigates through multiple review pages (limited to 10 pages for efficiency, adjustable as needed).
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Adapts to various review pages across different platforms.
- **Live Deployment**: Accessible through a Railway-hosted endpoint.
